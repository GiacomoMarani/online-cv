    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
          I am an energy engineer with a strong passion for technological innovation and artificial intelligence applied to the
          architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. I currently serve as Lead R&D at ATI Project, where I lead
          the development of data-driven solutions, automated workflows, and predictive algorithms to support sustainable
          design and operational efficiency in buildings.
          After earning my master’s degree in Energy Engineering from the University of Pisa, I gained extensive international
          experience, contributing to high-profile projects such as the New Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen and the New
          Odense University Hospital in Denmark. My work focuses on integrating BIM modeling with advanced energy
          simulations, leveraging tools like Revit, DesignBuilder (EnergyPlus), and programming languages such as Python to
          drive automation and data analysis.
          I have been involved in European initiatives like BIM4REN (Horizon 2020), aimed at enhancing the energy retrofit of
          existing buildings through digital methodologies. I also collaborate with leading research institutions such as the
          Scuola Normale Superiore and the Italian National Research Council (CNR) within the SoBigData project, promoting
          the use of big data and artificial intelligence for urban and environmental analysis.
          As a firm believer in interdisciplinary collaboration, I work at the intersection of technology and design, fostering an
          integrated approach where architects, engineers, and data scientists come together to tackle the challenges of
          sustainability and digital innovation in the construction industry. I envision a future where architectural design is
          increasingly data-driven, inclusive, efficient, and resilient.
          I ensure technological monitoring, experimentation, and solution design to drive innovation at the intersection of
          architecture, engineering, and artificial intelligence. By leveraging data-driven design, I focus on bridging Building
          Information Modeling (BIM) and Building Energy Modeling (BEM) to optimize performance and sustainability.
          Knowledge sharing is at the core of my work, fostering collaboration and advancing the use of AI and generative tools
          for smarter, future-ready designs.
